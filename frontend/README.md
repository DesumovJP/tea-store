## Google Analytics (GA4)

This project supports GA4 page-view tracking out of the box.

1) Add your measurement ID to `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

2) On localhost, nothing is sent if the var is empty. Once deployed and the env var is present, tracking is enabled automatically. Page views are reported on route changes (Next.js App Router).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Stripe setup

Add the following vars to `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Run local webhook forwarding:

```bash
stripe listen --events checkout.session.completed --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

Flow:
- Client posts to `/api/stripe/checkout` with cart, contact, and delivery.
- User pays at Stripe Checkout.
- Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` to `/api/stripe/webhook`.
- Webhook calls internal `/api/order` to email and persist the order in Strapi.
